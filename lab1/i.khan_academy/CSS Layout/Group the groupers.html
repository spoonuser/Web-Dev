<h1>Groupers</h1>

<div class="info"><p><span class="first-sentence">Groupers</span> are teleosts (ray-finned fishes), typically having a stout body and a large mouth. <span class="first-sentence">They</span> can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. <span class="first-sentence">They</span> swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. <span class="first-sentence">They</span> do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. <span class="first-sentence">They</span> habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. <span class="first-sentence">Reports</span> of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.</p>

  <p><span class="first-sentence">Their</span> mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. <span class="first-sentence">They</span> also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. <span class="first-sentence">Their</span>gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in.</p></div>
