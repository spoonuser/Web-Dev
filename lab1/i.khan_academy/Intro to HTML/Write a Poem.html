<h1>Tarantella</h1>
<p>Do you remember an Inn,<br>
  Miranda?<br>
  Do you remember an Inn?<br>
  And the tedding and the spreading<br>
  Of the straw for a bedding,<br>
  And the fleas that tease in the High Pyrenees,<br>
  And the wine that tasted of tar?<br>
  And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers<br>
  (Under the vine of the dark veranda)?<br>
  Do you remember an Inn, Miranda,<br>
  Do you remember an Inn?<br>
  And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers<br>
